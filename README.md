# SAGA (Super Artillery Goblin Attack)

## Story
You have to kill as many monsters as you can that are trying to destroy the human village. You are the only one who can keep the monsters away until the sorcerers finish their spell to banish them from this realm. You can go through all the region to find the best spot to shoot at the monsters and you can also buy upgrades and grenades to help you in your task.

## Description
This VR game was created to learn how to develop games with OpenXR and is a Unity shooter game.

The gameplay is about shooting at mobs during 3 minutes and to survive until the end of the game.
You can buy upgrades and grenades at a shop and teleport yourself to towers to have a better view of the map.

The grenades can be thrown on the ennemies to kill them and the upgrades can be used to improve your weapon.

The grenades can also be used on little towers placed at each corner of the map to transform them into detection bombs that will explode when 3 ennemies are close to them.

## Commands
- `Use the right joystick to teleport yourself to towers`
- `Use the right joystick to turn yourself around`
- `Use the right trigger to shoot`
- `With the A button it is possible to spawn a grenade that you can grab with the left hand and throw on the ennemies`

## Running the project
